# Overview

This is the code for Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence series. 
This is a lesson on Gaussian Mixture Models, they are probability distributions that consist of multiple Gaussian distributions.
This is useful for modeling more complex data, that has multiple peaks. Sometimes one bell curve isn't enough. We can optimize
this model for clustering so that we can classify the data into the discovered classes using the Expectation Maximization
algorithm.
